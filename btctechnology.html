					Digital cash is not a new phenomenon. It is estimated that more than 90% of world currencies are digital.
					<p>
						Cryptography isn't new either.
						A vast amount of modern security, such as banking and <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3583976/what-is-cryptography-how-algorithms-keep-information-secret-and-safe.html" target="_blank", style="color:#ff5800">web protection</a>, depends on cryptographic hash functions.
						 Its roots go back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank", style="color:#ff5800">Julius Caesar</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/hieroglyphic-writing/Cryptographic-hieroglyphic-writing" target="_blank", style="color:#ff5800">Egyptian Hieroglyphics</a>
					</p>
						Cryptocurrencies, therefore, are digital currencies which are secured by cryptographic technologies.
					<p>
						<br>
						<u style="text-decoration-color:#ff5800">What makes Bitcoin different?</u>
						<br>

					Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network in which transactions are publicly announced and the participants agree on the single order in which they were received.

						<p>
							The solution that Bitcoin offers is to verify whichever ledger has the most computational work put into it (a cryptographic hash function).
						</p>
					What keeps the consensus of this so-called ledger is something that is called a blockchain. 
					Blocks are edits to the list, done by digital signatures. Digital signatures (done via a secret key) cannot be forged.
					And to make sure that there is a standard order to these blocks, a block has to contain the hash of the previous block.

					<p>
						If you use computational work as a basis for what to trust, you can make it so fraudulent transactions and conflicting ledgers would require an infeasible amount of computation.
					</p>
						This computational work is called Proof of Work (POW). 
						<p>
							It is a process by which miners get to solve complex mathematical problems, and the winners are selected to add the newest batch of transactions to the blockchain.
						</p>
						Miners use GPU/CPU power. And their reward in BTC gets halved every four years.
					<p>
						POW also solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending" target="_blank", style="color:#ff5800">Double-Spend problem</a>.
					</p>
					<br>
					In short, Bitcoin is a decentralized, trust-less verification system based on math born in cryptography.
					<p>
						There is no need for 3rd party mediators, like banks.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						And each person on earth holds the potential to be their own bank.
